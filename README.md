# cpmimage
For users of <a href="http://www.moria.de/~michael/cpmtools/>CPMTools</a> and fans of <a href="http://www.winimage.com/download.htm">WinImage</a>, CPMImage is a WinImage-like GUI front-end for CPMTools, written in Python/tkinter. While Python/tkinter are cross-platform. CPMImage is being developed and tested under Ubuntu Linux exclusively, so there are likely incompatibilities with Windows and MacOS.
