If prompted for user/password, use NCJECulver and the generated personal access token.
PATs expire. If you find thats the case, generate a new one as follows:

    Log in to GitHub: Go to GitHub.com and log in with your account. You can use your account password from the webpage.
    Access Settings: Click on your profile picture in the top right corner, then click "Settings."
    Developer Settings: Scroll down to the bottom of the sidebar and click on "Developer settings."
    Personal Access Tokens: Click on "Personal access tokens" then "Generate new token."
    Token Description: Give your token a description so you can remember what it's used for.
    Select Scopes: Choose the scopes or permissions you'd like to grant this token. For general Git operations, selecting "repo" is usually sufficient.
    Generate Token: Click the "Generate token" button at the bottom of the page.
    Copy Your New Token: Make sure to copy your new personal access token now. You wonâ€™t be able to see it again!
